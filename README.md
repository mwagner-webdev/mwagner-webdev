## 💪 What I do best

- Solve problems, with code or, even better, without.
- Implement the solution that leads to the whole project having the simplest and most correct code possible.
- Orient myself in unfmailiar codebases, projects, languages.
- Find out what customers and users need in terms of functionality, not just isolated features.

## 🏆 Favorite languages, frameworks and tech

- TypeScript
- C++
- C (still a sweet spot in terms of complexity vs. power)
- Rust (currently learning)
- [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc)
- React
- React Native/Expo
- Kotlin for Android
- [BabylonJS](https://babylonjs.org)
- Linux (any other Unix a close second)
- Postgres
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- C#/.NET (some warts, but many solid ideas, LINQ ❤️)
- Lisp
- Tcl

## 🧐 My opinions

I am a moderately opinionated developer, as nearly all good developers are. I like to work with people who think like me, or are able to offer better counter-arguments to my positions 😎

- [Tcl](https://tcl-lang.org) was far ahead of its time (without its innovations the web would look very different today) and still does some things better than other languages ([regex engine](https://github.com/garyhouston/hsrex)!). We urgently need a dynamic, easy-to-learn language with comparable metaprogramming support, easy DSL creation abilities, clean standard library and intelligently managed backwards compatibility.
- Come to think of that, we need to replace bash/zsh/PowerShell with a more sane language 😁
- The popularity of static vs. dynamic typing oscillates in waves. Ultimately both have their uses and it comes down to Ousterhout's dichotomy.
- TypeScript is so great not because of static typing per se, but because it works around Javascript's type coercion warts and encourages clear contracts, much more so than Java, C# or most C++.
- AI will not replace developers in the foreseeable future, but the complexity of projects and requirements will increase dramatically, because we will be able to handle more of it 😀
- It's likely AI will solve the problem of legacy code completely for us 😊
- Now and in the future we need to be much more focused on decoding what customers want and need than on perfect architecture or code organization minutiae.
- Relational databases are still 👑 for anything that requires reporting and they offer relatively strong, cheap data consistency.
- We are much closer to finding the perfect back-end architecture than the perfect front-end architecture. The endgame for front-end is probably some kind of pure declarative language and an ever-closer convergence of design tools with frameworks. In a sense, Tk foreshadowed this.
- Lightweight bundles still matter in the age of 5G. A snappier website will always feel better for the average user.
- PHP is not that bad 😌, Python is not that good 😯 but it has good libraries.
- Wordpress has many right ideas buried under a slightly rustic API; it can be considered a kind of document database.
- Blockchain will stay around and find its niche while everyone is focused on AI.
- I don't like strict TDD but in general it's not a bad idea to write client code (which is often a test) first because it leads to cleaner APIs.
- Tests are good but not good enough. The confidence that they give while refactoring is often a false one and it is a bad idea to refactor "around" existing tests to avoid breaking them. Treat tests as guardrails for feature implementation, not as safety nets for large refactoring stunts.
- Refactoring is still good but always somewhat risky.
- There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

## ⚡ Projects not (publicly) on GitHub

My game project, [Earthen](https://earthengame.com), which I am developing together with a small team, is a browser-based multiplayer RPG set in an incredibly atmospheric, dangerous and unforgiving world.

I contribute to many projects at [AVANT ICONIC](https://avant-iconic.com/). Stay tuned for updates and open-source releases!
