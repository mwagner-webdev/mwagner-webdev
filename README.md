## üí™ What I do best

- Solve problems, with code or, even better, without.
- Implement the solution that leads to the whole project having the simplest and most correct code possible.
- Orient myself in unfamiliar codebases, projects, languages.
- Find out what customers and users need in terms of functionality, not just isolated features.

## üèÜ Favorite languages, frameworks and tech

- TypeScript
- C++
- C (still a sweet spot in terms of complexity vs. power)
- Rust (currently learning)
- [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc)
- React
- React Native/Expo
- Kotlin for Android
- [BabylonJS](https://babylonjs.com)
- Linux (any other Unix a close second)
- Postgres
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- C#/.NET (some warts, but many solid ideas, LINQ ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- Lisp
- Tcl

## ‚ö° Projects not (publicly) on GitHub

My game project, [Earthen](https://earthengame.com), which I am developing together with a small team, is a browser-based multiplayer RPG set in an incredibly atmospheric, dangerous and unforgiving world.

I contribute to many projects at [AVANT ICONIC](https://avant-iconic.com/). Stay tuned for updates and open-source releases!
